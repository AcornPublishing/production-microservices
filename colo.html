  <p>The animals on the cover of <em>Production-Ready Microservices</em> are leafcutter bees (of the genus <em>Megachile</em>). There are over 1,500 species of this insect, which is widespread throughout the world. One species from Indonesia, <em>Megachile pluto</em>, is thought to be the largest bee in the world: individuals can be up to 0.9–1.5 inches long.</p>

<p>Leafcutter bees gain their name from the female's common activity of cutting neat semicircles from the edges of leaves. She then carries these disc-shaped leaf pieces to her nest, which can be built in various places such as ready-made hollows, burrows in the ground, or rotting wood that the bee can bore into. Nests are between 4–8 inches long, cylindrical, and lined with leaf pieces in an overlapping pattern. These insects do not live in colonies, though it's possible for individuals to nest near each other. </p>  

<p>The females arrange their nests in separate cells (building from the inside out) and lay one egg within each, along with a regurgitated pollen-and-nectar ball for the larva to eat. It is theorized that the leaves keep the larva's food from drying out until it can be eaten.</p>

<p>Adult bees also feed on nectar and pollen, and are very efficient pollinators due to their vigorous swimming-like motion while inside flowers (which shakes a great deal of pollen loose and coats the long hairs on the insect's abdomen). Females often need to take 10–15 trips to provision an individual nest cell, further increasing their effectiveness in cross-pollination. Thus, these bees are welcome inhabitants in many gardens and farms; artificial nesting boxes or tubes can be placed to attract them.</p>
